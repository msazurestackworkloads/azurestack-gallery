They\r\n    apply to the software named above and any Microsoft services or software updates (except to the extent such\r\n    services or updates are accompanied by new or additional terms, in which case those different terms apply\r\n    prospectively and do not alter your or Microsoft\u2019s rights relating to pre-updated software or services). IF YOU\r\n    COMPLY WITH THESE LICENSE TERMS, YOU HAVE THE RIGHTS BELOW. BY USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p><b> 1.

ENTIRE AGREEMENT.<\/b> This agreement, and any other terms Microsoft may provide for supplements, updates,\r\n    or third-party applications, is the entire agreement for the software.<\/p>\r\n<p> <b>10. APPLICABLE LAW AND PLACE TO RESOLVE DISPUTES.<\/b> If you acquired the software in the United States or\r\n    Canada, the laws of the state or province where you live (or, if a business, where your principal place of\r\n    business is located) govern the interpretation of this agreement, claims for its breach, and all other claims\r\n    (including consumer protection, unfair competition, and tort claims), regardless of conflict of laws principles.\r\n    If you acquired the software in any other country, its laws apply. If U.S. federal jurisdiction exists, you and\r\n    Microsoft consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the federal court in King County, Washington for all\r\n    disputes heard in court. If not, you and Microsoft consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the Superior\r\n    Court of King County, Washington for all disputes heard in court.<\/p>\r\n<p> <b>11. CONSUMER RIGHTS; REGIONAL VARIATIONS.<\/b> This agreement describes certain legal rights.

Separate and\r\n    apart from your relationship with Microsoft, you may also have rights with respect to the party from which you\r\n    acquired the software. This agreement does not change those other rights if the laws of your state, province, or\r\n    country do not permit it to do so. For example, if you acquired the software in one of the below regions, or\r\n    mandatory country law applies, then the following provisions apply to you:<\/p>\r\n<p> <b>a) Australia.<\/b> You have statutory guarantees under the Australian Consumer Law and nothing in this\r\n    agreement is intended to affect those rights.<\/p>\r\n<p> <b>b) Canada.<\/b> If you acquired this software in Canada, you may stop receiving updates by turning off the\r\n    automatic update feature, disconnecting your device from the Internet (if and when you re-connect to the\r\n    Internet, however, the software will resume checking for and installing updates), or uninstalling the software.\r\n    The product documentation, if any, may also specify how to turn off updates for your specific device or\r\n    software.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p> <b>c) Germany and Austria.<\/b><\/p>\r\n<p><b>i. Warranty.<\/b> The properly licensed software will perform substantially as described in any Microsoft\r\n    materials that accompany the software. However, Microsoft gives no contractual guarantee in relation to the\r\n    licensed software.<\/p>\r\n<p> <b>ii. Limitation of Liability.<\/b> In case of intentional conduct, gross negligence, claims based on the\r\n    Product Liability Act, as well as, in case of death or personal or physical injury, Microsoft is liable\r\n    according to the statutory law.<\/p>\r\n<p>Subject to the foregoing clause ii., Microsoft will only be liable for slight negligence if Microsoft is in\r\n    breach of such material contractual obligations, the fulfillment of which facilitate the due performance of this\r\n    agreement, the breach of which would endanger the purpose of this agreement and the compliance with which a\r\n    party may constantly trust in (so-called \"cardinal obligations\").
