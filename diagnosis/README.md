# Troubleshooting

This short [guide](https://github.com/Azure/aks-engine/blob/master/docs/howto/troubleshooting.md) from the Azure's AKS Engine team has a good high level explanation of how AKS Engine interacts with the Azure Resource Manager (ARM) and lists a few potential issues that can cause AKS Engine commands to fail.

Please refer to this [article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-stack/user/azure-stack-solution-template-kubernetes-trouble) for specifics about how the `Kubernetes Cluster` marketplace item works on Azure Stack.

Follow this [article](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-stack/user/azure-stack-version-profiles-azurecli2) to configure and login to your Azure Stack instance using Azure CLI

## Gathering logs

The Bash scripts on this directory are aim to simplify the collection of relevant logs from your Kubernetes cluster. Instead of SSH-ing into the cluster nodes, you can simply download and extract the latest [release](https://github.com/msazurestackworkloads/azurestack-gallery/releases/download/diagnosis-v0.1.0/diagnosis.zip) and execute script `getkuberneteslogs.sh`  

These are the logs retrieved by the script:

- Microsoft Azure Linux Agent (waagent) logs
- Custom Script Extension logs
- Running kube-system container metadata
- Running kube-system container logs
- Kubelet service status and journal
- Etcd service status and journal
- Gallery item's DVM logs
- kube-system Snapshot

## Required Parameters 

`-u, --user`           - The administrator username for the cluster VMs

`-i, --identity-file`  - RSA private key tied to the public key used to create the Kubernetes cluster (usually named 'id_rsa')

`-g, --resource-group` - Kubernetes cluster resource group

## Optional Parameters

`-n, --user-namespace`         - Collect logs from containers in the specified namespaces (`kube-system` logs are always collected)

`--all-namespaces`             - Collect logs from containers in all namespaces. It overrides --user-namespace

`--disable-host-key-checking`  - Sets SSH's `StrictHostKeyChecking` option to `no` while the script executes. Only use in a safe environment.

`--upload-logs`                - Persists retrieved logs in an Azure Stack storage account. Logs can be found in `KubernetesLogs` resource group.

`--api-model`                  - Persists apimodel.json file in an Azure Stack Storage account. 
                                 Upload apimodel.json file to storage account happens when `--upload-logs` parameter is also provided.

`-h, --help`                   - Print script usage
