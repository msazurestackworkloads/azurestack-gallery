# Microsoft Azure Container Service Engine

The Azure Kubernetes Service Engine (aks-engine) generates ARM (Azure Resource Manager) templates for Docker enabled clusters on Microsoft Azure.

## How to Deploy a Kubernetes Cluster

The easiest way to deploy a Kubernetes cluster is through the Kubernetes Cluster marketplace item. This marketplace item wraps AKS Engine in order to simplify its usage. Behind the scenes, it deploys a Linux virtual machine, clones Azure Stack's fork, generate the AKS Engine templates and deploys them from the Linux virtual machine.

1. You need an Azure Service Principal (applications) from your tenant Azure Active Directory (Azure portal)
    1. Create a SPN in your AAD in Azure portal ([instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-create-service-principal-portal#create-an-azure-active-directory-application))
    2. Make sure your SPN has the [required permissions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal#check-azure-active-directory-permissions)
2. SSH keys are required to remote into the cluster nodes. Follow this [link](https://github.com/msazurestackworkloads/acs-engine/blob/master/docs/ssh.md#ssh-key-generation) if you need help creating the SSH keys
3. Add/upgrade the following items from Marketplace Management
    - Canonical's Ubuntu Server 16.04 LST
    - Custom Script for Linux 2.0
    - Kubernetes Cluster
4. Ensure that you have a valid subscription in your Azure Stack tenant portal (with enough Public IPs quota to try out a few applications)
5. Ensuring that the service principal has [access to the subscription](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-create-service-principal-portal#assign-application-to-role) in your Azure Stack tenant portal.
6. Deploy the Kubernetes Cluster marketplace item. This should roughly take 30 mins.
