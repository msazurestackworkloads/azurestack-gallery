They apply to the software named above and any Microsoft services or software updates (except to the extent such services or updates are accompanied by new or additional terms, in which case those different terms apply prospectively and do not alter your or Microsoft\u2019s rights relating to pre-updated software or services). IF YOU COMPLY WITH THESE LICENSE TERMS, YOU HAVE THE RIGHTS BELOW. BY USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS.<\/p><p>        1. INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS.<\/p><p>        a) General. You may install and use any number of copies of the software on your devices. You may not use the software in a live operating environment unless Microsoft permits you to do so under another agreement.<\/p><p>        b) Third Party Software. The software may include third party applications that Microsoft, not the third party, licenses to you under this agreement. Any included notices for third party applications are for your information only.<\/p><p>        c) Open Source Components. The software may contain third party copyrighted software licensed under open source licenses with source code availability obligations. Copies of those licenses are included in the ThirdPartyNotices file or other accompanying notices file. <\/p><p>        2. TIME-SENSITIVE SOFTWARE.<\/p><p>        a) Term. The term of this agreement is until 01\/06\/2019 (day\/month\/year).<\/p><p>        b) Notice. You may receive periodic reminder notices of this date through the software.<\/p><p>        c) Access to data. You may not be able to access data used in the software when it stops running.<\/p><p>        3. PRE-RELEASE SOFTWARE. The software is a pre-release version. It may not operate correctly. It may be different from the commercially released version.<\/p><p>        4. FEEDBACK. If you give feedback about the software to Microsoft, you give to Microsoft, without charge, the right to use, share and commercialize your feedback in any way and for any purpose. You will not give feedback that is subject to a license that requires Microsoft to license its software or documentation to third parties because Microsoft includes your feedback in them. These rights survive this agreement.<\/p><p>        5. DATA COLLECTION. The software may collect information about you and your use of the software and send that to Microsoft. Microsoft may use this information to provide services and improve Microsoft\u2019s products and services. Your opt-out rights, if any, are described in the product documentation. Some features in the software may enable collection of data from users of your applications that access or use the software. If you use these features to enable data collection in your applications, you must comply with applicable law, including getting any required user consent, and maintain a prominent privacy policy that accurately informs users about how you use, collect, and share their data. You can learn more about Microsoft\u2019s data collection and use in the product documentation and the Microsoft Privacy Statement at https:\/\/go.microsoft.com\/fwlink\/?LinkId=521839. You agree to comply with all applicable provisions of the Microsoft Privacy Statement.<\/p><p>        6. SCOPE OF LICENSE. The software is licensed, not sold. Microsoft reserves all other rights.

This agreement, and any other terms Microsoft may provide for supplements, updates, or third-party applications, is the entire agreement for the software.<\/p><p>        12. APPLICABLE LAW AND PLACE TO RESOLVE DISPUTES. If you acquired the software in the United States or Canada, the laws of the state or province where you live (or, if a business, where your principal place of business is located) govern the interpretation of this agreement, claims for its breach, and all other claims (including consumer protection, unfair competition, and tort claims), regardless of conflict of laws principles. If you acquired the software in any other country, its laws apply. If U.S. federal jurisdiction exists, you and Microsoft consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the federal court in King County, Washington for all disputes heard in court. If not, you and Microsoft consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the Superior Court of King County, Washington for all disputes heard in court.<\/p><p>        13. CONSUMER RIGHTS; REGIONAL VARIATIONS. This agreement describes certain legal rights. You may have other rights, including consumer rights, under the laws of your state, province, or country. Separate and apart from your relationship with Microsoft, you may also have rights with respect to the party from which you acquired the software. This agreement does not change those other rights if the laws of your state, province, or country do not permit it to do so. For example, if you acquired the software in one of the below regions, or mandatory country law applies, then the following provisions apply to you:<\/p><p>        a) Australia. You have statutory guarantees under the Australian Consumer Law and nothing in this agreement is intended to affect those rights.<\/p><p>        b) Canada. If you acquired this software in Canada, you may stop receiving updates by turning off the automatic update feature, disconnecting your device from the Internet (if and when you re-connect to the Internet, however, the software will resume checking for and installing updates), or uninstalling the software. The product documentation, if any, may also specify how to turn off updates for your specific device or software.<\/p><p>        c) Germany and Austria.<\/p><p>i. Warranty. The properly licensed software will perform substantially as described in any Microsoft materials that accompany the software. However, Microsoft gives no contractual guarantee in relation to the licensed software.<\/p><p>        ii. Limitation of Liability. In case of intentional conduct, gross negligence, claims based on the Product Liability Act, as well as, in case of death or personal or physical injury, Microsoft is liable according to the statutory law.<\/p><p>Subject to the foregoing clause ii., Microsoft will only be liable for slight negligence if Microsoft is in breach of such material contractual obligations, the fulfillment of which facilitate the due performance of this agreement, the breach of which would endanger the purpose of this agreement and the compliance with which a party may constantly trust in (so-called &quot;cardinal obligations&quot;). In other cases of slight negligence, Microsoft will not be liable for slight negligence.<\/p><p>        14. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED \u201CAS IS.\u201D YOU BEAR THE RISK OF USING IT. MICROSOFT GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES, OR CONDITIONS.

LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES. IF YOU HAVE ANY BASIS FOR RECOVERING DAMAGES DESPITE THE PRECEDING DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY, YOU CAN RECOVER FROM MICROSOFT AND ITS SUPPLIERS ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO U.S. $5.00. YOU CANNOT RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST PROFITS, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.<\/p><p>        This limitation applies to (a) anything related to the software, services, content (including code) on third party Internet sites, or third party applications; and (b) claims for breach of contract, warranty, guarantee, or condition; strict liability, negligence, or other tort; or any other claim; in each case to the extent permitted by applicable law.<\/p><p>        It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because your state, province, or country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential, or other damages.<\/p><p>        Please note: As this software is distributed in Canada, some of the clauses in this agreement are provided below in French.<\/p><p>        Remarque: Ce logiciel \u00E9tant distribu\u00E9 au Canada, certaines des clauses dans ce contrat sont fournies ci-dessous en fran\u00E7ais.<\/p><p>        EXON\u00C9RATION DE GARANTIE. Le logiciel vis\u00E9 par une licence est offert \u00AB tel quel \u00BB. Toute utilisation de ce logiciel est \u00E0 votre seule risque et p\u00E9ril.

Vous pouvez obtenir de Microsoft et de ses fournisseurs une indemnisation en cas de dommages directs uniquement \u00E0 hauteur de 5,00 $ US.

Si votre pays n\u2019autorise pas l\u2019exclusion ou la limitation de responsabilit\u00E9 pour les dommages indirects, accessoires ou de quelque nature que ce soit, il se peut que la limitation ou l\u2019exclusion ci-dessus ne s\u2019appliquera pas \u00E0 votre \u00E9gard.<\/p><p>        EFFET JURIDIQUE. Le pr\u00E9sent contrat d\u00E9crit certains droits juridiques. Vous pourriez avoir d\u2019autres droits pr\u00E9vus par les lois de votre pays. Le pr\u00E9sent contrat ne modifie pas les droits que vous conf\u00E8rent les lois de votre pays si celles-ci ne le permettent pas.<\/p>",
